## War or Peace

## Overview
In this project, I wrote a program to simulate a game of [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game). A user will be able to create two players, and watch them ‘play’ the game.

## Learning Goals
- Follow an interaction pattern
- Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
- Write tests
- Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)
- Host code on Github and submit a Pull Request
