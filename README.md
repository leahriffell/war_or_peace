## War or Peace

## Overview
In this project, I wrote a program to simulate a game of war. By running the war_or_peace_runner.rb file, the user will be able to watch two players play the game.

## Learning Goals
- Follow an interaction pattern
- Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
- Write tests
- Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)
- Host code on Github and submit a Pull Request
